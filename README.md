The Genesis project

Genesis is a system that will encourage, incentivize, and fund the creation of value that is shared with a creative commons license. It will do this by binding a distributed currency to a distributed index of content. The currency will be issued at a fixed rate e.g. 100 coins per day. These coins will be issued to users who have submitted popular content. The popularity of content on the network will be determined by the amount of hashing power that has been voluntarily contributed to mine coins for the producer of the content. No controls will be put in place that could limit or dis-incentivize the submission of content. Content will then be shared to users via swarming protocol. 

As such genesis will create a decentralized ecosystem complete with its own index and decentralized search facilities, a content distribution network, and an economy with a flatter distribution of new capital.   

Should there be a dispute about the origin of content on the network, a 3 party arbitrage system will allow the submitter of content to negotiate with the plaintiff. The 2 parties will have the opportunity to negotiate before involving the audience of the content. If the audience is involved, they will have the option to chose who should receive their donations or to reallocate the generated coins. 

New features and modifications to Genesis will also be funded and prioritized the by voluntarily contributed hashing power.

The roadmap for this project includes the development of the following features:

Distribution of open source apps that compile from included distributed code repositories. 
Membership schemes that cover cost related to health and human rights protection. 
Distributed online courses with peer review system allowing students to progress through subject matter. 
Distributed crowd sourced micro loans/ credit escalation systems.
Distributed health care system. 
Distributed human rights protection systems. 
Distributed crowd funding. 
eCommerce  
Social networking
Everything else one might want in a free and open society.

This project is still at the conceptual stage
